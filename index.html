            alt="">The capybara or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to
        South America.
        It is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the
        lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more
        distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense
        forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as
        100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide
        and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.</p>
    <p class="a"><img align="right" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/77/191677-050-3CBF2834/Capybara.jpg" alt="">Capybaras are
        short-haired brownish rodents with blunt snouts, short legs, small ears, and
        almost no tail. They are shy and associate in groups along the banks of lakes and rivers. They normally feed in
        the morning and evening and spend most of the day resting under cover along the banks. They are vegetarian and
        in cultivated areas sometimes become pests by eating melons, grain, and squash. They swim and dive readily and
        commonly enter water to elude predators such as jaguars and anacondas. The female bears a single litter of three
        to eight young each year; gestation takes about 100 to 110 days.</p>

            alt="">Its common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination of kaá (leaf) + píi
        (slender) + ú (eat)
        + ara (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater". The genus name,
        hydrochoerus, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χοῖρος (choiros "pig, hog") and the species name,
        hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χαίρω (chairo "feel happy, enjoy").</p>

        The lesser capybara (H. isthmius) is smaller, growing to about 1 metre (about 3 feet) in length and weighing
        about 28 kg (62 pounds). Some classifications list capybaras as the only members of family Hydrochoeridae,
        whereas others place them within the subfamily Hydrochoerinae of the family…

        You thought the beaver was a rodent of unusual size? The capybara is twice that big—the biggest rodent on Earth.
        These impressive semi-aquatic mammals are found throughout much of northern and central South America, though a
        small invasive population has been seen in Florida. They’re closely related to guinea pigs and rock cavies, and
        more distantly related to chinchillas and agouti.

        Like beavers, capybaras are strong swimmers. Their pig-shaped bodies are adapted for life in bodies of water
        found in forests, seasonally flooded savannas, and wetlands. Their toes are partially webbed for paddling
        around, and their reddish to dark brown fur is long and brittle—perfect for drying out quickly on land. Small
        eyes, noses, and hairless ears are located high on their heads so that their faces remain exposed and alert when
        most of their body is submerged.

        Being alert is important when you’re often dinner for jaguars, pumas, and, in the water, caimans. Capybara young
        have even more to worry about—they are a favorite snack food of snakes like the boa constrictor, crab-eating
        foxes, small cats, and birds of prey like the caracara and black vulture.

        They also eat their own feces in the morning. That’s when their poo is protein rich from the high number of
        microbes digesting the previous day’s meals. Because the grasses they eat are so hard to digest, eating their
        waste essentially allows them to digest it twice.
