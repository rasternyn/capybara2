            alt="">The capybara[a] or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to
        South America.
        It is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the
        lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more
        distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense
        forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as
        100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide
        and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.</p>
    <p><img align="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Capybara_skeleton.jpg/1280px-Capybara_skeleton.jpg" alt="">Its common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination of kaá (leaf) + píi
        (slender) + ú (eat)
        + ara (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater". The genus name,
        hydrochoerus, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χοῖρος (choiros "pig, hog") and the species name,
        hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χαίρω (chairo "feel happy, enjoy").</p>

        capybara (H. isthmius) is smaller, growing to about 1 metre (about 3 feet) in length and weighing about 28 kg
        (62 pounds).
